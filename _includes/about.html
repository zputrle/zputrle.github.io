<p>Hi, my name is Å½iga Putrle, and I'm a software developer living in Ljubljana, Slovenia. For the last couple of years I was developing medical software at <a href='https://www.cosylab.com/'>Cosylab</a> but currently I'm working towards my master's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Ljubljana. <br><br> I'm enthusiastic about a lot of things but mostly my interests revolve around programming, control systems, programming language theory, logic, computability, automata theory, computational geometry, algorithms and math in general. <br><br> Please feel free to contact me at <a href='mailto:{{contact@zputrle.com}}'>contact@zputrle.com</a>. I'm always glad to grab a cup of coffee and exchange ideas. <br><br> Have a great day!</p>
